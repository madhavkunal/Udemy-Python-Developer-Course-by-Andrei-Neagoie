- Web Scraping is programmatically (such as using Python) grabbing data from a website. 
- Downloading a web page, downloading the data, cleaning the data and using the data
- Browser and Server communicate through JS, HTML, CSS Files

- Use Cases: 
    - Sales Leads
    - Marketing
    - Real Estate
    - Job Search

- Many websites don't like people scraping their data especially parts of it. You can append most urls with ' /robots.txt ' to see the lists of things certain websites allow and disallow you and online agents, bots and crawlers to scrape. Technically you can still web scrape (because HTML is always public) anything but ethically you shouldn't. 

- User-agent: Googlebot -> online agent or bot that Google uses to crawl and index websites 
    - Web Crawler -> Program that crawls websites (reads and analyzes them)

- API (Application Programming Interface). Many wesbites provide you APIs formatted in JSON data that give you access to different tools. These can be free or paid.
