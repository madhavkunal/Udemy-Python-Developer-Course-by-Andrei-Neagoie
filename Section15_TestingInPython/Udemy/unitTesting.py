The Assert library in Python is a powerful tool that can be used to test
 assumptions and ensure the correctness of your code. It provides a number of methods that can be used to assert the state of your program, such as:
assertEqual(a, b): Asserts
 that the values of a and b are equal.
assertNotEqual(a, b): Asserts that the values of a and b are not equal.
assertTrue(a): Asserts that the value of a is True.
assertFalse(a): Asserts that the value of a is False.
assertIs(a, b): Asserts that a and b are the same object.
assertIsNot(a, b): Asserts that a and b are not the same object.
assertIn(a, b): Asserts that the value of a is in the sequence b.
assertNotIn(a, b): Asserts that the value of a is not in the sequence b.
assertIsNone(a): Asserts that the value of a is None.
assertIsNotNone(a): Asserts that the value of a is not None.
assertRaises(exception
, function, *args, **kwargs): Asserts that the function raises the specified exception when called with the given arguments.
